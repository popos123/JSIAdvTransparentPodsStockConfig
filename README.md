This is IVA addon aka transparent windows to stock pods based on JSI Advanced Transparent Pods.
This mod works on KSK 1.12.5 version.
Dependencies:
1. https://github.com/JPLRepo/JSIAdvTransparentPods/
2. https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/ModuleManager/
For now there is a small glitch in VAB / SPH - when you turn on transparent preview it shows white mask that is littlebit too big and its flickering.
Also i don't know how to implement only IVa mask so i was create a new IVA views instead.
